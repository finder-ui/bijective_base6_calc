## üí° What is Bijective Base-6?

This application is an educational tool for exploring **bijective base-6 numeration**. Unlike standard number systems, it has two key properties:

1.  **No Zero**: The digits are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.
2.  **Bijective**: Every positive integer has one, and only one, unique string representation (e.g., `7` is always `11`, never `011`).

Counting proceeds like an odometer that can't show zero. After `6`, the next number "rolls over" to `11`. This property makes it incredibly useful in computer science for creating compact, unambiguous identifiers.
