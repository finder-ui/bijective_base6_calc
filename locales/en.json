    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal to bijective base-6 is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers naturally work with remainders from 0 to 5, but our digits are 1 to 6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",

    "formalLangDesc1": "The bijective base-6 system has a deep and beautiful connection to formal language theory, a cornerstone of theoretical computer science.",
    "formalLangDesc2": "In this field, we define an alphabet, Sigma, as a set of symbols. For our system, the alphabet is Sigma = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.",
    "formalLangDesc3": "The set of all possible strings that can be created using this alphabet is known as the Kleene star (or Kleene closure) of Sigma, denoted as Sigma*. This set includes strings of any finite length: {empty string, 1, 2, ..., 6, 11, 12, ..., 66, 111, ...}.",
    "formalLangDesc4": "The bijective base-6 system is essentially a perfect, ordered enumeration of the Kleene star of the alphabet {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, if we map the empty string to zero. Every positive integer corresponds to exactly one string, and every string corresponds to exactly one positive integer. This is incredibly powerful because it provides a seamless way to assign a unique number to any sequence of events or choices from a set of six, a fundamental operation in algorithms and computability theory.",
    "geomTitle": "A Geometric Interpretation: The Infinite 6-ary Tree",
    "geomDesc1": "We can visualize the entire system as an infinite, complete 6-ary tree. A 6-ary tree is a structure where every node has exactly six children.",
    "geomDesc2": "The root of the tree can be thought of as a starting point (representing the number 0 or the empty string).",
    "geomList": [ "The first level of nodes are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.", "Each of those nodes has six children. For example, node \"1\" is the parent of nodes \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", and \"16\"." ],

    "hashingTitle": "A Note on Collisions and Hashing",
    "hashingDesc": "Observing the multiplication table reveals that <code>2 Ã— 3 = 6</code> and <code>1 Ã— 6 = 6</code>. This is a <strong>collision</strong>. While interesting mathematically, this property is the opposite of what is desired in cryptographic hashing functions (like SHA-256), which must be specifically designed to make finding collisions computationally infeasible. This system, therefore, is a good tool for understanding the concept of collisions, but it is not a secure hashing algorithm itself.",
    "prosTitle": "Advantages of Bijective Base-6",
    "prosIntro": "The zero-less nature of this system provides several unique benefits, especially in computing and human-readable identifiers.",
    "pros": [
        { "title": "Unambiguous & Human-Friendly", "desc": "No leading zeros means no confusion. <code>123</code> is always <code>123</code>, never <code>0123</code>. This is ideal for product codes, serial numbers, or short links where clarity is critical." },
        { "title": "Compact & Efficient", "desc": "Every possible string of digits is a valid number, making it a highly dense and efficient way to represent data. There are no wasted or invalid combinations." },

        { "title": "No Null Pointers (A Theoretical Idea)", "desc": "Since every string is a valid number, there's no 'empty' or 'null' representation. This aligns with modern programming concepts aimed at eliminating null-reference errors, a common source of bugs." }

        { "title": "Conversion Overhead", "desc": "It's not a native system for computers (which use binary) or humans (who use decimal). A conversion step is always required when interfacing with other systems, adding computational overhead." },
        { "title": "Limited Native Support", "desc": "Very few programming languages or standard libraries have built-in functions for bijective numeration. This means developers must implement custom logic for all arithmetic and conversion operations." },
        { "title": "Complex Multiplication Patterns", "desc": "Unlike standard bases where multiplying by the base simply adds a zero, the patterns in bijective multiplication are less intuitive, making it harder to perform quick estimations or calculations." }
