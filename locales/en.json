    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. The \"base\" of a system tells us how many unique digits are used.",
    "primerDesc2": "In these standard systems, the digit <strong>zero</strong> is essential as a <strong>placeholder</strong>. It signifies an empty position, like the tens place in <code>101</code>. The bijective system is fascinating because it works without this.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. Because there is no zero, the system \"rolls over\" differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "fingerCountingTitle": "A Practical Advantage: Counting Higher on Ten Fingers",
    "fingerCountingDesc": "With our standard base-10 system, we can count from 0 to 9. With a bijective system, you can assign each finger a positional value. Your right hand could be the \"ones\" place (digits 1-5), and your left hand could be the \"sixes\" place. By holding up 5 fingers on your right hand (value 5) and 1 on your left (value 1*6), you can represent the number 11 (bijective), which is 7 in decimal. This allows you to count much higher with more intuitive finger combinations.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers use remainders from 0-5, but our digits are 1-6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
    "applicationsTitle": "Practical Applications",
    "appDesc1": "Bijective numeration is more than a curiosity; it solves real-world problems in computer science.",
    "appSpreadsheet": "<strong>Spreadsheet Columns:</strong> Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets use a bijective base-26 system (A-Z). After Z comes AA, then AB. This is a perfect real-world example where there is no \"zeroth\" column.",

    "advFactorizationTitle": "A Note on \"Composite\" Digits and Factorization",
    "advFactorizationDesc": "An astute observer will notice that <code>2 × 3 = 6</code>, but also <code>1 × 6 = 6</code>. In this system, the digit <strong><code>6</code></strong> itself acts like a composite number. This reveals a deep property: the set of single digits does not form a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain\" target=\"_blank\">Unique Factorization Domain</a>, a direct consequence of using the base `k` as a digit instead of `0`.",
