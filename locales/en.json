    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means a digit's value depends on its position. The 'base' of a system tells us how many unique digits are used.",
    "primerDesc2": "In standard systems, <strong>zero</strong> is an essential placeholder. The bijective system is fascinating because it works without this.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. Because there is no zero, the system 'rolls over' differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers use remainders from 0-5, but our digits are 1-6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
    "algoExampleTitle": "Let's convert the decimal number <strong>43</strong>:",
    "algoSteps": [
        "<strong>Step 1:</strong> <code>(43 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit in <code>'123456'</code> is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(43 - 1) / 6 = 7</code>.",
        "<strong>Step 2:</strong> <code>(7 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(7 - 1) / 6 = 1</code>.",
        "<strong>Step 3:</strong> <code>(1 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(1 - 1) / 6 = 0</code>."
    ],
    "algoResult": "Reversing the digits gives <code>111</code>. Thus, 43 in decimal is 111 in bijective base-6.",

        "<strong>Spreadsheet Columns:</strong> Excel and Google Sheets use a bijective base-26 system (A-Z). After Z comes AA, then AB. This is a perfect real-world example where there is no 'zeroth' column.",

    "advancedTitle": "Deeper Mathematical Connections",
    "advFactorizationTitle": "A Note on 'Composite' Digits",
    "advFactorizationDesc": "An astute observer will notice that in the multiplication table, <code>2 × 3 = 6</code>, but also <code>1 × 6 = 6</code>. In this system, the digit <strong><code>6</code></strong> itself acts like a composite number, and the digits <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code> are the 'primes' of this single-digit world. This is a direct consequence of using the base `k` as a digit instead of `0`.",
    "advFingerCountingTitle": "A Fun Insight: Counting Higher on 10 Fingers",
    "advFingerCountingDesc": "With our standard base-10 system, you can count from 0 to 9 on your fingers. With a bijective system, you can do better! If you assign each finger a value from 1 to 10, you can represent numbers far higher. For example, holding up one finger could be '1', while holding up all ten could be the bijective number for 1023 (in base-2). This system provides a more efficient way to map sets of choices (like raised fingers) to numbers.",
