    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal to bijective base-6 is to temporarily shift the number system. We bridge the gap between computer remainders (0-5) and our digits (1-6) by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",

    "formalLangDesc1": "The bijective base-6 system has a deep and beautiful connection to formal language theory, a cornerstone of theoretical computer science.",
    "formalLangDesc2": "In this field, we define an alphabet, Sigma, as a set of symbols. For our system, the alphabet is Sigma = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.",
    "formalLangDesc3": "The set of all possible strings that can be created using this alphabet is known as the Kleene star (or Kleene closure) of Sigma, denoted as Sigma*. This set includes strings of any finite length: {empty string, 1, 2, ..., 6, 11, 12, ..., 66, 111, ...}.",
    "formalLangDesc4": "The bijective base-6 system is essentially a perfect, ordered enumeration of the Kleene star of the alphabet {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, if we map the empty string to zero. Every positive integer corresponds to exactly one string, and every string corresponds to exactly one positive integer. This is incredibly powerful because it provides a seamless way to assign a unique number to any sequence of events or choices from a set of six, a fundamental operation in algorithms and computability theory.",
    "geomTitle": "A Geometric Interpretation: The Infinite 6-ary Tree",
    "geomDesc1": "We can visualize the entire system as an infinite, complete 6-ary tree. A 6-ary tree is a structure where every node has exactly six children.",
    "geomDesc2": "The root of the tree can be thought of as a starting point (representing the number 0 or the empty string).",
    "geomList": [ "The first level of nodes are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.", "Each of those nodes has six children. For example, node \"1\" is the parent of nodes \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", and \"16\"." ],
    "geomDesc4": "In this model, every bijective base-6 number is the unique \"address\" or \"path\" from the root to a specific node. For example, the number 425 means:",

    "hashingTitle": "A Note on Collisions and Hashing",
    "hashingDesc": "Observing the multiplication table reveals that <code>2 Ã— 3 = 6</code> and <code>1 Ã— 6 = 6</code>. This is a <strong>collision</strong>, where different inputs produce the same output. While interesting mathematically, this property is the opposite of what is desired in cryptographic hashing functions (like SHA-256), which must be specifically designed to make finding collisions computationally infeasible. This system, therefore, is a good tool for understanding the concept of collisions, but it is not a secure hashing algorithm itself.",
