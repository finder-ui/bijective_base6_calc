    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",

While interesting mathematically, this property is the opposite of what is desired in cryptographic hashing functions (like SHA-256), which must be specifically designed to make finding collisions computationally infeasible. This system, therefore, is a good tool for understanding the concept of collisions, but it is not a secure hashing algorithm itself.",
