    "explanationDesc1": "It's a positional system using digits <strong>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</strong>. After <code>6</code>, the sequence continues to <code>11</code>, <code>12</code>, etc., just like spreadsheet columns (A-Z, then AA). This one-to-one mapping (a &quot;bijection&quot;) between numbers and their string representations is its key feature.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers use remainders from 0-5, but our digits are 1-6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
    "algoExampleTitle": "To convert the decimal number <strong>43</strong>:",
    "algoStep1": "<strong>Step 1:</strong> <code>(43 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit in <code>&quot;123456&quot;</code> is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>floor((43 - 1) / 6) = 7</code>.",
    "algoStep2": "<strong>Step 2:</strong> <code>(7 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>11</strong>. Next number: <code>floor((7 - 1) / 6) = 1</code>.",
    "algoStep3": "<strong>Step 3:</strong> <code>(1 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>111</strong>. Next number: <code>floor((1 - 1) / 6) = 0</code>.",

    "prosUnambiguous": "<strong>Unambiguous:</strong> Every number has exactly one representation. <code>007</code> is not possible, only <code>7</code>. This is critical for identifiers.",
    "prosCompact": "<strong>Compactness:</strong> Generally more compact than standard positional systems for the same number of available symbols.",
    "prosNoNull": "<strong>No 'Null Pointer':</strong> In a theoretical computer built on this system, the classic 'null pointer exception' (accessing address 0) wouldn't exist, as the first address is 1.",
    "consTitle": "Disadvantages",
    "consArithmetic": "<strong>Complex Arithmetic:</strong> Standard addition and multiplication algorithms must be modified to handle the lack of a zero placeholder, which can be less intuitive.",
    "consUnfamiliar": "<strong>Unfamiliarity:</strong> It is not widely known or taught, making it a barrier for general-purpose use without specific training.",
    "darkSecretTitle": "The Philosophical Implication of a Zero-less World",
    "darkSecretDesc": "The absence of zero is not just a curiosity; it has profound philosophical implications. In our mathematics, zero represents both a quantity (nothing) and a concept (the origin). A bijective system has no symbol for nothingness. The number zero is represented by the empty stringâ€”the absence of symbols. This implies a universe where the concept of 'nothing' isn't a state to be represented, but a true void.",
