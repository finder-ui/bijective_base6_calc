    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. The \"base\" of a system tells us how many unique digits are used.",
    "primerDesc2": "In these standard systems, the digit <strong>zero</strong> is essential as a <strong>placeholder</strong>. It signifies an empty position, like the tens place in <code>101</code>. The bijective system is fascinating because it works without this.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but has no zero; the digits are <strong>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</strong>. Because there is no zero, the system \"rolls over\" differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers use remainders from 0-5, but our digits are 1-6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
    "algoExampleTitle": "Let's convert the decimal number <strong>43</strong>:",
    "algoSteps": [
        "<strong>Step 1:</strong> <code>(43 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit in <code>\\\"123456\\\"</code> is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(43 - 1) / 6 = 7</code>.",
        "<strong>Step 2:</strong> <code>(7 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(7 - 1) / 6 = 1</code>.",
        "<strong>Step 3:</strong> <code>(1 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(1 - 1) / 6 = 0</code>."
    ],
    "algoResult": "Reversing the digits gives <code>111</code>. Thus, 43 in decimal is 111 in bijective base-6.",

        "<strong>Spreadsheet Columns:</strong> Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets use a bijective base-26 system (A-Z). After Z comes AA, then AB. This is a perfect real-world example where there is no \"zeroth\" column.",
        "<strong>URL Shorteners:</strong> Services like bit.ly use a bijective base-62 system (<code>a-z, A-Z, 0-9</code>) to map massive database IDs to short, unique, and readable strings.",
        "<strong>Counting on Your Fingers:</strong> With ten fingers, you can count to 10 in decimal. But in a bijective system, you can go much higher! If each finger can be up (1) or down (2), you have a bijective base-2 system. With 10 fingers, you can represent 2¹⁰ = 1024 numbers. This shows the power of dense, zero-less representation."

    "advFactorizationTitle": "A Note on 'Composite' Digits and Factorization",
    "advFactorizationDesc": "An astute observer of the multiplication table will notice that <code>2 × 3 = 6</code>, but also <code>1 × 6 = 6</code>. In our standard system, 6 has a unique prime factorization (2 and 3). However, in the bijective system, <strong>the digit <code>6</code> itself acts like a composite number</strong>. The digits <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code> are the \"primes\" of this single-digit world. This reveals that the set of single digits does not form a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain\" target=\"_blank\">Unique Factorization Domain</a>, a direct consequence of using the base `k` as a digit instead of `0`.",
    "advFormalLangTitle": "Connection to Formal Language Theory",
    "advFormalLangDesc": "The bijective base-6 system has a beautiful connection to theoretical computer science. If we define an alphabet, Σ, as our set of digits <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</code>, then the set of all possible finite strings (the Kleene Star, Σ*) can be perfectly enumerated by the positive integers. This provides a seamless way to assign a unique number to any sequence of choices from a set of six.",
    "advGeoTitle": "Geometric Interpretation: The Infinite Tree",
    "advGeoDesc": "We can visualize the system as an infinite, complete 6-ary tree, where every node has six children. Every bijective base-6 number is the unique \"address\" or path from the root to a specific node. The number <code>425</code> means: start at the root, take the 4th branch, then the 2nd, then the 5th. This is crucial for indexing hierarchical data where every part of the address is a meaningful choice.",
