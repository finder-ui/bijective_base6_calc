    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means a digit's value depends on its position. The \"base\" of a system tells us how many unique digits are used.",
    "primerDesc2": "In these standard systems, the digit <strong>zero</strong> is essential as a <strong>placeholder</strong>. The bijective system is fascinating because it works without this.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. Because there is no zero, the system \"rolls over\" differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers use remainders from 0-5, but our digits are 1-6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
    "algoExampleTitle": "Let's convert the decimal number <strong>43</strong>:",
    "algoSteps": [
        "<strong>Step 1:</strong> <code>(43 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit in <code>\"123456\"</code> is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(43 - 1) / 6 = 7</code>.",
        "<strong>Step 2:</strong> <code>(7 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(7 - 1) / 6 = 1</code>.",
        "<strong>Step 3:</strong> <code>(1 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next number: <code>(1 - 1) / 6 = 0</code>."
    ],
    "algoResult": "Reversing the digits gives <code>111</code>. Thus, 43 in decimal is 111 in bijective base-6.",
    "fingerCountingTitle": "A Fun Advantage: Finger Counting",
    "fingerCountingDesc": "Here’s a fun insight: this system is surprisingly efficient for counting on your fingers. Using one hand for the 'ones' place (1-6) and the other hand for the 'sixes' place, you can easily count much higher than 10. For example, showing <strong>2</strong> fingers on your 'sixes' hand and <strong>5</strong> fingers on your 'ones' hand represents the number <code>25</code> (bijective), which is 17 in decimal (2*6 + 5). You can count up to 42 (66 in bijective) using just your fingers!",

    "appList": [
        "<strong>Spreadsheet Columns:</strong> Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets use a bijective base-26 system (A-Z). After Z comes AA, then AB. This is a perfect real-world example where there is no \"zeroth\" column.",
        "<strong>URL Shorteners:</strong> Services like bit.ly use a bijective base-62 system (<code>a-z, A-Z, 0-9</code>) to map massive database IDs to short, unique, and readable strings."

    "advFactorizationTitle": "A Note on 'Composite' Digits",
    "advFactorizationDesc": "An astute observer will notice that <code>2 × 3 = 6</code>, but also <code>1 × 6 = 6</code>. In this system, the digit <strong><code>6</code></strong> itself acts like a composite number, and the digits <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code> are the \"primes\" of this single-digit world. This is a direct consequence of using the base `k` as a digit instead of `0` and highlights the system's unique algebraic structure.",
    "advFormalLangTitle": "Connection to Formal Language Theory",
    "advFormalLangDesc": "The bijective base-6 system is a perfect, ordered enumeration of all possible strings from the alphabet <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</code>. This is a fundamental concept in computability theory for assigning a unique number to any sequence of choices.",
    "advGeoTitle": "Geometric Interpretation: The Infinite Tree",
    "advGeoDesc": "We can visualize the system as an infinite 6-ary tree, where every number is a unique path from the root. The number <code>425</code> means: start at the root, take the 4th branch, then the 2nd, then the 5th. This is crucial for indexing hierarchical data where every part of the address is a meaningful choice.",
