    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. The \"base\" of a system tells us how many unique digits are used. The value of each position is an exponent of the base, starting from 0 on the right.",
    "primerDesc2": "In these standard systems, the digit <strong>zero</strong> is essential. It is not just a number, but a fundamental <strong>placeholder</strong>. It signifies an empty position, like the tens place in <code>101</code>. The bijective system you are exploring is fascinating because it works without this placeholder.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. Because there is no zero to act as a placeholder, the system \"rolls over\" differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc": "The trick to converting from decimal to bijective base-6 is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers naturally work with remainders from 0 to 5, but our digits are 1 to 6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
