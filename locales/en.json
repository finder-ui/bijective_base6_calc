    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal to bijective base-6 is to temporarily shift the number system. We bridge the gap between computer remainders (0-5) and our digits (1-6) by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",

    "hashingDesc": "Observing the multiplication table reveals that <code>2 × 3 = 6</code> and <code>1 × 6 = 6</code>. This is a <strong>collision</strong>, where different inputs produce the same output. While interesting mathematically, this property is the opposite of what is desired in cryptographic hashing functions (like SHA-256), which must be specifically designed to make finding collisions computationally infeasible. This system, therefore, is a good tool for understanding the concept of collisions, but it is not a secure hashing algorithm itself.",
