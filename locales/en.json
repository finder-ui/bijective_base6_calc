    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. The \"base\" of a system tells us how many unique digits are used.",
    "primerDesc2": "In these standard systems, the digit <strong>zero</strong> is essential as a <strong>placeholder</strong>. It signifies an empty position, like the tens place in <code>101</code>. The bijective system is fascinating because it works without this.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. Because there is no zero, the system \"rolls over\" differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers use remainders from 0-5, but our digits are 1-6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",
    "algoExampleTitle": "Let's convert the decimal number <strong>43</strong>:",
    "algoStep1": "<strong>Step 1:</strong> <code>(43 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit in <code>\"123456\"</code> is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next n: <code>(43 - 1) / 6 = 7</code>.",
    "algoStep2": "<strong>Step 2:</strong> <code>(7 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next n: <code>(7 - 1) / 6 = 1</code>.",
    "algoStep3": "<strong>Step 3:</strong> <code>(1 - 1) % 6 = 0</code>. The 0th digit is '1'. Result: <strong>1</strong>. Next n: <code>(1 - 1) / 6 = 0</code>.",
    "algoResult": "Reversing the digits gives <code>111</code>. Thus, 43 in decimal is 111 in bijective base-6.",
    "fingerTitle": "A Practical Advantage: Finger Counting",
    "fingerDesc": "With ten fingers, we can easily count to 10. But what if each hand represented a digit in bijective base-6? You could represent numbers far greater than 10. For example, showing <strong>1</strong> finger on your left hand and <strong>5</strong> on your right would represent the number <code>15</code> (bijective), which is 11 in decimal. Showing <strong>6</strong> and <strong>6</strong> would be <code>66</code> (bijective), which is 42 in decimal!",
    "applicationsTitle": "Practical Applications",
    "appDesc1": "Bijective numeration is more than a curiosity; it solves real-world problems in computer science.",
    "appSpreadsheet": "<strong>Spreadsheet Columns:</strong> Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets use a bijective base-26 system (A-Z). After Z comes AA, then AB. This is a perfect real-world example where there is no \"zeroth\" column.",
    "appUrl": "<strong>URL Shorteners:</strong> Services like bit.ly use a bijective base-62 system (<code>a-z, A-Z, 0-9</code>) to create the shortest possible unique strings for billions of links.",
    "advancedTitle": "Deeper Mathematical Connections",
    "advFactorizationTitle": "A Note on 'Composite' Digits",
    "advFactorizationDesc": "An astute observer will notice that <code>2 × 3 = 6</code>, but also <code>1 × 6 = 6</code>. In this system, the digit <strong><code>6</code></strong> itself acts like a composite number, and the digits <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code> are its \"primes\". This is a direct consequence of using the base `k` as a digit instead of `0` and highlights the system's unique algebraic structure.",
    "advFormalLangTitle": "Connection to Formal Language Theory",
    "advFormalLangDesc": "The bijective base-6 system is a perfect, ordered enumeration of all possible strings from the alphabet {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This is a fundamental concept in computability theory for uniquely identifying any sequence of choices.",
    "advGeoTitle": "Geometric Interpretation: The Infinite Tree",
    "advGeoDesc": "We can visualize the system as an infinite 6-ary tree, where every number is a unique \"address\" or path from the root to a specific node. The number <code>425</code> means: take the 4th branch, then the 2nd, then the 5th. This is crucial for indexing hierarchical data.",
