    "primerDesc1": "Most number systems we use are <strong>positional</strong>. This means a digit's value depends on its position. The \"base\" tells us how many unique digits are used. The value of each position is an exponent of the base, starting from 0 on the right.",
    "primerDesc2": "In these standard systems, the digit <strong>zero</strong> is essential. It is not just a number, but a fundamental <strong>placeholder</strong>. It signifies an empty position, like the tens place in <code>101</code>. The bijective system is fascinating because it works without this placeholder.",
    "explanationTitle": "Understanding the Bijective System",
    "explanationDesc1": "This system is a <strong>bijective base-6 numeration</strong>. It is positional, but with two key differences: it has no zero, and its digits run from 1 to 6. Because there is no zero to act as a placeholder, the system \"rolls over\" differently. After <code>6</code>, the next number is <code>11</code>.",
    "algoTitle": "The Conversion Algorithm Explained",
    "algoDesc1": "The trick to converting from decimal to bijective base-6 is to temporarily shift the number system. Computers naturally work with remainders from 0 to 5, but our digits are 1 to 6. We bridge this gap by subtracting 1 before each calculation.",

    "appSpreadsheet": "<strong>Spreadsheet Columns:</strong> Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets use a bijective base-26 system (A-Z). After Z comes AA, then AB. This is a perfect real-world example where there is no \"zeroth\" column.",

    "appFingerCounting": "<strong>Finger Counting:</strong> While humans can count to 10 on their fingers, a bijective system allows for much higher counts. By assigning values 1-6 to different finger positions, one could easily count to <code>6^10</code> (over 60 million) using just their hands!",
    "advancedTitle": "Deeper Mathematical Connections",
    "advFactorizationTitle": "A Note on 'Composite' Digits and Factorization",
    "advFactorizationDesc": "An astute observer of the multiplication table will notice something curious: <code>2 Ã— 3 = 6</code>, but also <code>1 Ã— 6 = 6</code>. In our standard number system, the number 6 has a unique prime factorization (2 and 3). However, in the bijective system, <strong>the digit <code>6</code> itself acts like a composite number</strong>. The digits <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code> are the \"primes\" of this single-digit world. This reveals a deep property: the set of single digits in a bijective system does not form a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain\" target=\"_blank\">Unique Factorization Domain</a>. This is a direct consequence of using the base `k` as a digit instead of `0`.",
    "advFormalLangTitle": "Connection to Formal Language Theory",
    "advFormalLangDesc": "The bijective base-6 system has a beautiful connection to theoretical computer science. If we define an alphabet of symbols, Î£ (Sigma), as our set of digits <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</code>, then the set of all possible finite strings you can create with these symbols is called the Kleene Star, denoted Î£*. The bijective system is a perfect, ordered enumeration of this set.",
    "advGeoTitle": "Geometric Interpretation: The Infinite Tree",
    "advGeoDesc": "We can visualize the entire system as an infinite, complete 6-ary tree, where every node has exactly six children. The root represents a starting point. The first level of nodes are labeled 1 through 6. In this model, every bijective base-6 number is the unique \"address\" or path from the root to a specific node.",
