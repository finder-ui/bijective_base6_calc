        "<strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Every integer has exactly one representation. This eliminates bugs from leading zeros (e.g., <code>007</code> vs <code>7</code>) in identifiers, configuration files, or API endpoints.",
        "<strong>Naturally Sortable:</strong> The lexicographical order of bijective strings matches their numerical order. This simplifies sorting and indexing operations without special handling.",
